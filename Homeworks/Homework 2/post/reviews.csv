Ishea Young-Taylor,Today,5.0,Uh Freaking Amazing!!!!,"Hotel is so cute. As soon as u step in to the doors you are greeted and treated like a valued customer. My husband booked this hotel for my birthday trip and as soon as we checked it I was greeted with a few happy birthday days and my name was on our flat screen TV as we entered the room.....lol The rooms are clean, the beds comfy and the view from our room on the 29th floor was stunning. The bar next to the lobby was nice and so was the restaurant. We loved the added security for the elevator. You can't access it without a key card so u don't have to worry about strangers roaming the hallways. Yasmin from the front desk was a god send. She texted us daily to get up dates on our stay and to see if our needs where being met. We was just a 15-20 min walk from time square, 5th Ave and the empire state building. We had a ball and will definitely stay here again.",February 2023
Alice L,Feb 2022,5.0,Perfect for Us,"We recently chose Motto for an overnight in NYC and were so glad we did. Our stay started off with a warm and friendly greeting from the staff at the front desk. Check in was easy and efficient. We found our room to be clean and comfortable- brand new! Quite beautiful. The view from our room as the sun was setting was spectacular! After an evening at the theatre ( highly recommend The Music Man!), the bar was open for a night cap. Breakfast was fresh and delicious served by more friendly staff. Our overall experience was exceptional! We’ll be back",February 2022
uk,Yesterday,4.0,The saviour of our NYC trip,"We originally had booked to stay at a different hotel for our 6 night visit to NYC but unfortunately we were not impressed on our arrival so we checked out after a night and booked the Motto. We had seen this hotel briefly whilst searching for accommodation but was put off by the Hilton brand as we’ve had mixed experiences in the past.First impressions:The location of the hotel is good and the lobby/bar area is lovely. Marissa checked us in to a room on the 28th floor. When we got into the room we found we had been put in an adjoining room which we didn’t feel comfortable in. We called down to reception and Marissa straight away transferred us to a room on the 20th floor with an upgraded ‘landmark view’ which we were really happy with. Room:The rooms have obviously been designed with space in mind. Plenty of room to store our 2 large suitcases and drawers/shelves to put away clothes. The room had a safe, fridge (empty) and big TV opposite the bed which you can log into Netflix on. We like a cool room and the air conditioning was great. The mattress and pillows were both very comfortable and the sound proofing of the room was good. The shower was very hot and the water pressure very strong. Facilities:We didn’t eat in the restaurant or bars so can’t really comment though the downstairs bar in the lobby is lovely. If we were being picky, it would be nice to have an extra couple of elevators as the 4 the hotel had were busy during our stay - although the longest we had to wait was 5 minutes. We don’t really have any negative comments to make. All the staff were lovely and made our stay enjoyable.",February 2023
Jonathan F,Yesterday,5.0,"Pleasant, value hotel smack in the middle of New York City.",Just a really great hotel. Achieved a lot with a fairly small room. Pleasant. Amazing shower (one of the best I’ve had actually). Helpful staff and a well run lobby.Their breakfast muffin is seriously one of the best I’ve had in New York. The other stuff was ok. Kyalin Z. Was especially incredible and helpful.,February 2023
Kristina D,Yesterday,5.0,Very friendly staff,"I stayed at motto for 6 nights!The rooms were small, but I knew this before.the view from the 42nd floor was spectacular. The breakfast was very tasty but expensive!the elevators were slow and you had to wait.I really liked the decoration and the customer service was 10/10…  when I had a little incident with my knee, Ina helped me a lot, and stayed with me until my husband came. I didn't get a chance to thank her.A beautiful woman inside out!We will definitely come back to Motto!",February 2023
scott w,Feb 19,5.0,"Great room, great service, great location",Room was fantastic and the service was outstanding. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping was fast and efficient. Had one of the best cocktails at the the bar from super friendly bartenders. Great location and would definitely stay here again.,February 2023
Louis M,Feb 19,5.0,Motto NYC Chelsea,"We had an excellent one-night stay at the Motto - NYC Chelsea.  Our room was very nice and had a beautiful view of downtown NYC.  Shout out to Kyalin, Edgar and Yasmin at the front desk for their hospitality.",February 2023
Brady,Feb 19,3.0,Whats in a name?,Its the Hilton name so booked on that assumption. Pros:GymBarStaff Cons:Cost vs valueNo tea coffee in roomsSmall rooms No lounge service Bar very expensive - like eye watering!!Finishing touches on decor. Paint in room had very poor finish. Average rating as cons outweighed pros.,February 2023
Robsen,Feb 17,5.0,Just perfect!,At first the arrival there was amazing. Ina from the front office made us feel like home. Greetings from germany to you! The view from our room was amazing. The housekeeping did a good job and the restaurant also. The food here is so delicious.,February 2023
Kristin N,Feb 16,5.0,"Great Hotel, Wonderful Customer Service!","I've stayed at the Motto hotel several times over the past 6 months for business.  Their rooms are well-apportioned and very clean-  which is saying a lot because I am very picky about cleanliness ;) On my most recent stay, there was a small issue in my room with the plumbing making a lot of noise which kept me up all night.  I asked the front desk the next morning to either have someone look at it or change my room.  The gentleman at the front desk that I spoke to was so friendly (unfortunately I didn't get his name) and offered to have someone look at the room right away.  Additionally the manager, Yasmin,  went well out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable and was taken care of. Her care and customer service was outstanding and as a result, I will  continue to make the Motto my choice for my future travel.  I would highly recommend this hotel for both business travelers and leisure travelers!",February 2023
koldoVergara_77,Feb 16,5.0,amazing!,"happy to be back to NY after 16 years!Great Welcome @Motto by Hilton, and specially the kindness of the whole crew from bartenders and reception.special mention to the lovely smile of Kyalin!definitely will come back!",February 2023
sgoldberg75093,Feb 16,5.0,Good hotel for a quick trip.,This is a brand new hotel (a year old) and still had a new feel to it.  It is a European-style hotel with small but comfortable rooms.  No closet but places to hang clothes.  Sink is outside the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and the view was spectacular of downtown NYC including the Statue of Liberty (the landmark view).  It was just one night but would stay there again.,February 2023
Khyree R,Feb 16,5.0,"Great viewssss, no microwave","Had a view of the Freedom Tower! What a way to spend my Valentine’s Day! Marissa was a great help. I was located on the 38th floor. The room was very clean. The bar served my favorite wine as well! My only complaint wad when i called to heat up my food, they did not have a microwave. Cold Chinese food it is",February 2023
Saf,Feb 15,5.0,"Great views, clean, beautiful boutique feel hotel","This is my first ever solo trip to anywhere and I was a bit nervous and apprehensive about the journey as a solo woman, especially after hearing that New Yorkers can be quite abrupt but as soon as I got to the hotel Yasmin greeted me with the warmest welcome, handed me a Fiji water and was so friendly along with her colleague.It really helped alleviate my nervousness being greeted like that and I asked if there were any rooms with great views available as I wanted to take pictures and videos and she accommodated me as soon as she could (after 2 nights in my original room on the 12th floor - 1206).The room on 12th floor was still a fair bit high with a peek of the city buildings from the sides but the room I moved to on the 38th floor (3803) had the most perfect view of the New York high rise buildings and I got a stunning Timelapse the next morning of the sunrise - well worth the wait.Both rooms I stayed in were ones with King beds and pretty much the same layout. It’s all very compact at the Motto hotel so if you’re used to a lot of floor space this may feel small but there are space saving holes on either side under the bed for luggage which was good although it didnt fit large luggage cases without them sticking out a bit.I noticed the hot water took longer to turn on (a few mins) on the higher 38th floor and there was a loud drain noise sometimes when the toilet flushed, but other than that it was a pleasant stay with a fridge for any food I brought back and you can even log into your Netflix account if you want to catch up with your shows.The Super Bowl was on one of the nights I was staying at the Motto and I wanted to see what the atmosphere was like as it’s something very American that I never really understood, but I worried about safety (even though I felt like Chelsea is a safe enough area to walk around at night).I stayed in the lobby of the hotel and ate my dinner where they were showing the game and Yasmin was there again and super friendly which I really appreciated as a solo woman. She took pictures for a couple and I could see she’s the type of person who goes above and beyond in her job which is really admirable when you’ve come across many in the hospitality industry who are so unfriendly and unaccommodating.. I wish all hospitality workers had this level of attention and efficiency!Because of my fab experience at this hotel and the great location I definitely will be coming back again!",February 2023
Mile C,Feb 15,5.0,A gem in Chelsea!,"A phenomenal experience! These folks have nailed hospitality! From the time I checked in to the time I checked out (I stayed for a week), the staff was friendly, accommodating and responsive. The room I was in was great for a single traveler but would have been a bit small for 2 people. No desk in the room, just a bench and small side table. Hooks on the wall instead of closet space and I called the front desk to get an iron and ironing board sent to my room, which they brought within 10 mins. There wasn’t one in the room. The location is right next to many restaurants and Starbucks. The restaurant in the hotel was where I ate breakfast each morning and everything I had was fantastic! The wait staff was great and very attentive in the hotel restaurant. A great value for the price I paid. I will be staying here again very soon. Give it a try to see for yourself!",February 2023
Fearless706378,Feb 15,5.0,Enjoyable 2nd annual trip to NYC and Motto!!,"We had our 2nd annual trip to NYC to Motto for a play, dinner and sightseeing!  We were treated royally at the Motto and all the staff were welcoming and friendly from the front desk, to the bellman and security as well as the bar and the restaurant.  The young woman bartender even remembered our order later that night from our afternoon cocktails.  Just a wonderful, warm and inviting place!!",February 2023
First L,Feb 14,5.0,Great people!,This is the 2nd time I stayed at Motto. I love the location and their beautiful lounge area on the 2nd floor. Both Jasmine and Z were the best and super helpful. In fact everyone I encountered was super friendly and helpful. I had a noise issue with a connecting room but got it switched to a higher floor and much quieter. The only few things I wish was there was a microwave and coffee maker in the room. But I understand how cumbersome be in the modem rooms. Over all I would visit again.,February 2023
Maria Jose Game,Feb 14,5.0,Great long weekend at Motto,"We came for an anniversary trip to one of our favorite cities and Motto helped make it an unforgettable experience. The location is wonderful, right at Chelsea just a couple of blocks from Eataly where we will go every morning for the perfect capuchino with a cornetto. The room was impecable and  well designed to make every space  very efficient.   Everyone was nice and helpful, and make and it easy to check in and out. We try the food at the restaurant and was surprisingly good.",February 2023
Jennifer M,Feb 13,5.0,Great Stay!,"Spent 4 nights at Motto NYC and had a great time!  Arrived after a day of travel. Had completed online check-in so just a quick stop at the desk was needed to collect our room card. Yasmin gave us a quick overview of the hotel amenities and we were in the elevator on the way up to the 42nd floor in a matter of minutes.Our room was a King Landmark City View room and the view was spectacular! Rooms are NYC small (so keep that in mind) but the layout was so efficient that the room never “felt” small. Our room was at the end of the hall and was very quiet! The only noise we heard was an occasional slam as another guest let their door slam closed but with only 10 rooms/floor that wasn’t often.The bathroom itself has a sliding door to separate it from the room and  contains a really nice sized shower and the toilet. Bathroom sink is in the room itself. Mirror over the sink has really nice perimeter lighting for make-up, etc. Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand soap and lotion are all in full size, multi-use bottles. This area also has the mini-fridge.There is no closet so be aware of that. There is a panel (3 rows of 3 hooks each) of hooks on the wall as you walk in and another row of 4-5 hooks near the bed along with some hangers. We knew this in advance and brought some cheap wire hangers from home. Even without the extra hangers, hanging space was more than enough for 4 days for us!  Built in to the foot of the bed are 3 drawers. One contains the safe but the remaining 2 drawers, in addition to a drawer and shelf in the nightstand, are available for clothing. There are cut-outs under both sides of the bed for luggage storage.Hotel has a full service bar/restaurant but we did not eat there so can’t comment on the food.  Happy hour w/ reduced drink prices on select wines/beer/and mixed drinks as well as some food is offered daily 4-6:30 in the Lounge on the 2nd Floor (though they were short staffed our first couple nights so it was in the main bar on the 1st floor those nights). The first floor bar also has a station on the bar near the door to the outside where you can refill your water bottle if you’d like.Location was really convenient to pretty much everything via subway. There is a subway station right around the corner that made travel to Greenwich Village, 9/11 Memorial, etc pretty easy.We did read reviews that talked about how slow/full the elevators can be at times. We did encounter this on Sunday and Monday morning around checkout time. Other than that, no problems at all. So, just leave yourself a bit of time if you have somewhere you absolutely need to be at a certain time. Another issue that seems to have been brought up is the noise level of the A/C. We did not find it to be overly loud however we could not figure out a way to keep the fan on continuously rather than having it cycle on and off. To me it’s the change in noise that prevents me from sleeping soundly. There may have been a way to change the setting that we just didn’t figure out and we had earplugs so wasn’t a big deal. Check-out with Kyalin went just as smoothly as check-in! Very quick and we were on our way!Overall, beautiful new hotel, fantastic service and convenient location! We had a great time and would definitely stay here again!",February 2023
Georgy,Feb 13,5.0,"Great Hotel, great location, very friendly staff","Defenitely we can recommend that hotelVery friendly staff, especially Ken & Edgar at the receptionWe had a room in the 37st floor and had an amazing view over the whole cityPerfect stay for visiting NY",February 2023
Charlotte L,Feb 13,5.0,Fabulous!,I stayed on a Thursday night. Fabulous hotel great price and Yasmin was so helpful and checked me in and out with ease! Would definitely stay again. Very well positioned in Manhattan. The bed was comfortable and was very clean. Yasmin was out standing,February 2023
778moni,Feb 12,3.0,Great hotel but poor sound isolation,"Very nice hotel, cool design, friendly and courteous staff, good location  and great food. The 3 (out of 5 stars) are because of the very noisy ac (even after asking the staff to check it) and the fact that you could hear every door closing on the floor, very shower being taken, every chat on the corridor and every flush of the toilet.",February 2023
Margie G,Feb 11,5.0,I love the Motto,"One of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at!!! Service is top tier, room was nice and clean and smells so good as soon as you walk in, the restaurant they have in the hotel is delicious, Yasmin is such a great host. Made sure I was enjoying my stay! Definitely coming back to stay at the Motto when I visit New York again.",February 2023
Evan O,Feb 10,5.0,Awesome service and view!,"We spent a long weekend at The Motto and were amazed by the room and service! The style of the room was fantastic, it was well stocked with amenities, and the view of the Manhattan skyline was gorgeous! The bar in the lobby was excellent, and the cocktails we had were delicious. The hotel was incredibly clean and welcoming too. The staff were friendly, helpful, and very responsive for any questions we had during our stay. Alex, Jasmine, Sam, and Kareem at the front desk were all friendly and made sure our experience was a blast. We loved the Motto and definitely plan on staying there again next time we're in NYC!",February 2023
Ellen L,Feb 10,5.0,My son was getting married and i found out 4 days ago!,Jasmine was working the front desk!  She went above and beyond to work with me to coordinate the rooms so we could be near each other and even added a special gift bag for the bride and groom!  Jasmine was caring and engaged!   Thank you for your help!,February 2023
Kyaire,Feb 10,5.0,"Friendly staff, amazing views, comfortable beds!","Everything was amazing. The staff was friendly from the second I entered the lobby, to when I checked out. They kindly held my bag while I ran some errands for work. Kyalin, in particular, was very helpful when I was checking out. She advised me that I could leave bag with the hotel, and welcomed me to sit in the lobby area and complete my work tasks. The bed was very comfortable. Lastly, the view. The view from my room was amazing. I will definitely stay again! Thank you Motto.",February 2023
Diya G,Feb 9,5.0,Great place to stay in nyc,The reception desk staff are professional and helpful. The rooms are clean and has all amenities. Great thing is one doesn’t hear any street noise. Convenient location and the food is delectable. Will definitely stay here in the future. I’d love for the room to have a coffee machine at least.,February 2023
Jane N,Feb 9,5.0,would def come back,A beautifully designed hotel in a great location. It was easy to get anywhere and walking distance to a lot of spots. They have a good happy hour from 4-7 and the staff was super helpful. Z at the front desk was super friendly and helped to make sure that I had an enjoyable stay.,February 2023
Kate R,Feb 8,5.0,A favorite in NYC,"I have enjoyed staying at the Motto twice in the past 4 months.  The staff is professional and personable. They have always gone above and beyond to be helpful and accommodating.  The hotel is very clean, updated and the rooms are spacious for NYC.  I love the views and I will keep coming back!",February 2023
mexico0416,Feb 8,5.0,Clean & Friendly Staff,"First and foremost I would like to thank the staff for making us feel welcome - especially to Alex, Marrissa, & Kyalin. Our during Christmas weekend 2022 was perfect! We enjoyed our view, breakfast, and we were not that far from where we wanted to sight see! Thank you again!",December 2022
JettGrimes,Feb 8,5.0,"High quality rooms, and very friendly staff!","My room was very nice and luxurious. I had such a nice view of the buildings around the hotel, and what made it even better was the staff. Z (Zeyad) was the nicest person I've probably met in my life, and he went above and beyond in trying to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. I personally think that Z (Zeyad) should get a raise, or a promotion. Overall, I will be coming back in the near future, and I hope to see Z there!",February 2023
Rebecca K,Feb 7,5.0,Super friendly staff!,"Lovely room, quiet. Z (Zeyad) was super nice and more than accommodating. Really enjoyed my stay and would book it again. Comfy bed and promptly sent ice up to the room for my sore feet after a long day of walking. Thank you!",February 2023
Alhodges,Feb 7,5.0,Excellent,"I spent 8 days at the Motto and really loved my stay. I have been to many hotels around the area and so glad i decided to try Motto, as it is now a firm favourite. Room was very comfortable and clean, with amazing views; excellent gym; and the staff were so lovely. Everyone went above and beyond to make me feel very welcome and there was a great vibe from the staff, which is rare to find. Thanks to the whole team for such a special stay.",February 2023
Jab8799,Feb 5,5.0,Cozy and Clean! Perfect base for NYC.,"I want to write a review that puts people on the edge of booking in a comfortable position. My thing about hotels mainly is the cleanliness. If your looking for a clean hotel and don’t care about having a huge room this is perfect. When you go to new York you’re mainly out and about all day. This is exactly what you need. The shower water pressure was more than fine to debunk some of the other reviews. Bed was clean and comfortable. We didn’t call downstairs once, but the front desk was more than helpful when we checked in. I’d stay here again 100x over. It’s a small clean room with a king bed that you don’t need to spend much time in. Great home base!!!",February 2023
Vic S,Feb 5,5.0,First Choice Every Time,"We have stayed at this hotel multiple times in the last 12 months. We stumbled upon it whilst looking for a fresh spot in Chelsea. Our first visit was so good we’ve been back here each time we’re in Manhattan. There are lots of choices in the area, however we pick this place each time. Rooms: great size, clean, comfy beds, they have everything you need and the views are spectacular, the price alone is worth it for the views. The facilities are also worth calling out, gym is small but well equipped, the lounge area is large and accommodating. There’s two places in this hotel where they excel though, the restaurant and the front desk. Breakfast is a must, the team that works weekends are amazing (shout out to Jamika who is always 100% attentive!) menu is diverse, food is quality, space is inviting. The check in process is stellar, everyone is happy to see you, interested in what you’re here for and how they can make your stay great. Yasmin on the front desk is a star, we have worked with her multiple times. This visit she checked us in, helped with a few questions and made sure our stay was great.Thanks to the whole team at this hotel - you’re doing a great job!See you again soon!",February 2023
Kari C,Feb 5,5.0,Fabulous Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Motto by Hilton in Chelsea for the second time. This will be my go to hotel, when ever in NYC! It is in a fabulous neighborhood, with many things in walking distance and easy subway access. It is more quiet and calm than staying in The Times Square area. This visit we arrived after I dislocated my elbow, three days before. We were pleasantly surprised with being “guest of the day!” Our room was upgraded to a landmark view and wine and snacks were left in our room. It was a wonderful surprise, as I had to spend more time than typical in the room.Staff is amazing no matter who it is on shift, however we were treated extra special by Yasmin. Whenever I needed ice for my elbow, she would have it sent up ASAP.Yes, the rooms are small, but set up so well functionally and we never felt cramped. We will return for sure in the future!",January 2023
SamBBer,Feb 5,5.0,Beautiful place & perfect location,"We like to enjoy a weekend in NYC from time to time and this hotel is great, perfect location, beautiful & clean tiny rooms, and great service. Kaylin and Edgar at the front desk are great and super helpful. And if you choose the room on the high floors, the view is stunning! We’re definitely coming back!",December 2022
joel l,Feb 4,3.0,"No closet, no desk, no dresser","I understand that hotel rooms are often on the small size in NYC, but this room had the sink outside the bathroom and in the room itself, there was no closet, just hooks with three hangers, no desk at all, just a snack table, and no dresser, just three drawers under the bed, one of which housed the room safe. I would not stay here again.",February 2023
lauryn r,Feb 4,5.0,Yasmin is amazing!,Yasmin was absolutely amazing!!! She really helped me and she was so kind!! I was in NY shopping for wedding dresses and she left me a sweet note. It really made my trip worth while!! I can’t wait to go back and stay there again.,January 2023
Tom I,Feb 2,5.0,Amazing location and view.,"Motto Chelsea was just amazing, the help of Zeyad and his warm welcome was great ! We were at the 36 floor and the view is just unbelievable, room was amazing  with smart luggage compartment. The location was also amazing right in the middle of the city. If you arrive from JFK or Newark penn station train station is 8minute walk from the hotel no need to pay a Taxi.Ultra fast lift is a plus. Amazing experience thank you Motto Team",January 2023
Passport58331943467,Feb 2,5.0,Amazing property and staff!,"I booked a stay to celebrate my partner’s birthday; the property and service exceeded all expectations for our special time together. For one, the lobby is absolutely gorgeous. When you walk in, you’re met by the friendly front desk staff and incredible bar that has cool modern finishes and fixtures. We were assigned a room with a great city view; the room was perfectly cleaned and sized for the two of us to comfortably enjoy. Every part of the property was neat and tidy, from the elevators to the lounge to even the fitness center. The entire place just exudes cozy vibes. Marissa especially went above and beyond to ensure my partner and I had the best stay possible. She was very kind, knowledgeable, patient and attentive. Thank you, Motto staff, for the great memories. Looking forward to our next stay!",January 2023
Wade4020,Feb 2,5.0,Just a great comfortable experience.,"The last few times I have traveled to NYC I have stayed at the Hilton Motto.  There are several reason.  The staff is fantastic and very focused on the quality of your stay.  I the beds are great and the pillows are fantastic.  The rooms are well designed and have excellent views.  The whole hotel is clean, sharp and welcoming.  I love this place.  I hope to stay here in the future.",February 2023
Paradise99206,Feb 1,4.0,Awesome location,"A great location. Rooms were clean and functional. The elevators were fast getting us up to the 34 th floor quickly. Kareem was able to resolve my issue in quick time. Breakfast was excellent. We celebrated my wife’s 60th in style. I really like the gym, this hotel has all that’s needed for a great NYC stay.",January 2023
bjkennedy,Feb 1,5.0,Awesome!!!,Awesome hotel.  Comfortable beds and very quiet rooms.  I don’t hear a thing from other guest rooms.  The view is spectacular if you’re up on a high floor.  The restaurant bar is very good.  I’ve had dinner in there every night and the food and service are great.  Happy hour pricing is very reasonable.  Location is great too.  Food and shopping all very close.,January 2023
Ayse W,Feb 1,5.0,Great stay at Motto Chelsea,"We recently stayed at Motto Chelsea while visiting our son and loved it! The front desk was very helpful- especially Kareem. The rooms are smaller but had everything we needed and the bed was VERY comfortable- I want this mattress for home! Didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant, but it looked great. We will definitely be staying here on all our future visits.",January 2023
Kathleen R,Feb 1,5.0,Every Visit is Fantastic,This is a new hotel in the neighborhood and my clients are nearby so I’ve been staying pretty frequently.  Every visit is just as good as the last.  And I love the 2nd floor living room for getting work done.  Its like being at home (except with a bar).Thanks Motto!,January 2023
Andrea,Jan 2023,5.0,Perfect girls trip!,"Beautiful and spacious hotel, good location, affordable price and great staff. Thank you Andres and Kaylin for the great customer service.Plenty of groceries stories, food options and cafes around the area. Convenient  locations to all subway.",January 2023
Lori H,Jan 2023,5.0,Perfect stay!,"From the moment we arrived I knew I made the right decision to book this hotel for our quick weekend trip. We arrived early with a lot of luggage. We asked if they could hold it until it was time to check in, not only did they hold it for us, they texted us as soon as our room was ready so we were able to check in early! When we came back they promptly gave us our keys AND took all of the luggage to our room. Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. I’ve never felt so welcomed by any other hotel. The room was on the small side as most in Manhattan are but it was laid out well so it felt like you had plenty of room for a couple. The landmark city view room has a wonderful view from Chelsea all the way to downtown. You can even see the Statue of Liberty in the distance! The hotel is modern and clean and smelled incredible, so refreshing and welcoming after encountering those unwanted odors throughout the city all day. We grabbed a burger at the restaurant downstairs which honestly wasn’t great but it didn’t change my opinion of our wonderful stay. It’s in a great location next to plenty of restaurants, bars, and a short walk to the subway. 10/10 would recommend this hotel to anyone!",January 2023
Manuel M,Jan 2023,5.0,January trip to remember!,"Wonderful staff! Friendly, welcoming, helpful. Clean rooms, beautiful property; great overall experience and service. We would definitely return soon! Close to shops and public transportation. Housekeeping and front desk were very attentive from the moment we arrived",January 2023
netllama,Jan 2023,4.0,staff issues made it less than great,"We spent 10 nights here.  The hotel property itself is pretty great. Excellent location (near multiple subway lines, walking distance to lots of great stuff). The room was in great condition, with good AC, good wifi, and a shower that had excellent water pressure and hot water (most of the time, more on that below).  Beds were comfortable.However, there were a number of persistent staff issues that went unresolved.  On the first morning (before 7AM) of our stay, I got only cold water in the shower, despite waiting minutes. After contacting the front desk, they said it was due to planned overnight boiler work, which they neglected to notify us about.  Then a week later, all of the water was a brown color, with poor water pressure.  When we reported that to the front desk, they claimed that house keeping had left a note in everyone's rooms the day before. However, we had the 'do not disturb' tag on our door the previous day, such that house keeping never entered our room, therefore never left us the note about the work. I suggested that notices such as this should be posted in a public location, such as near the elevators, so that they can't be missed. The person basically dismissed my feedback and gave me a passive aggressive ""is there anything further that I can do to help you now?"" response, which was unhelpful. What they can do is improve communications so that people don't get unpleasant surprises that are avoidable.  The final issue was persistent for the entire stay, which was very slow/erratic elevator service. The property has 4 elevators, however, much of the time, at least one of them was out of service (or more accurately commandeered by staff).  It was not unusual to have to wait 5+ minutes to get an elevator.  Each elevator included a panel showing which floor it was currently on, and we'd watch while at least one of them would be ""stuck"" on the same floor for multiple minutes.  Sometimes, it would be the C (cellar) floor, which is restricted to staff.  There were also a few occasions, where a member of staff would board an elevator while we were in it, and swipe their badge and send the elevator to a floor in the *opposite* direction than we needed to go (sending it up when we were going down, or vice versa).  Its pretty frustrating trying to get an elevator, and having to wait for minutes at all hours of the day & night, while staff are hijacking them. Why isn't there a dedicated employee elevator?  Why are the staff holding elevators while paying customers are standing around waiting?Despite the staff issues, it was a good experience over all.",January 2023
